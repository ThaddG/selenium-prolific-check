# selenium-prolific-check

This small project was made for me to be notified when a new survey on the prolific website appears.

To make the files work:
  For the firefox file:
    line 15: add a path to gecko driver on your computer
    line 33: enter an email for the prolific account to be checked
    line 34: enter the password for the email
  
  For the headless file:
    line 17: add a path to gecko driver on your computer
    line 34: enter an email for the prolific account to be checked
    line 35: enter the password for the email

...this one is still being worked on. The loop needs to be modified.
